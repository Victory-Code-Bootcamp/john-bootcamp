<p>I am a native of Dallas, TX but have lived in the Seattle area since '95. I have a background in community organizing which began with the Black Prisoners Caucus (BPC) at Monroe-WSRU and was deepened with the People's Institute for Survival and Beyond and the Village of Hope, where I gained an anaylsis and practical experience applying that anaylsis in my personal and professional life. My day job is doing racial equity work inside City government. However, I remain deeply connected to a base of community organizers and movements committed to racial justice. I have two grown sons who are my hereos in many ways. Good jazz and hip hop music feed my soul, and I'm always in search of strong black coffee. </p>
<p>I became aware of this Victory Code Bootcamp from an email blast which came from an introduction to Unloop and David Almeda a few years back. Excited and grateful to be here. I'm hoping to gain the skills to support small community based organizations and social justice movements with their presence on the Web.</p>
