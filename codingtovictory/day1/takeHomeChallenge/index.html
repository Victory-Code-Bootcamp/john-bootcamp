    <p>Day 1 I joined the Victory Code Slack Channel. Today, Saturday 5/4, I connected with a teammate Beau and we spent time taling on the phone getting to know each other. Also, I was able to connect with my mentor, Ruxin, who reached out. We are planning to meet over zoon tomorrow, Sunday 5/5, at 7pm
