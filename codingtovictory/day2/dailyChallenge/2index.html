    <h1>JP's Den (for real)</h1> <h2> Freelance Consumer of Jazz Music</h2>
</body>
<p>I am a native of Dallas, TX but have lived in the Seattle area since '95.<br>I have a background in anti-racist community organizing which began with the Black Prisoners' Caucus <a href="https://www.theblackprisonerscaucus.org/">(BPC.org)</a> at Monroe-WSRU and was deepened with the People's Institute for Survival and Beyond <a href="https://pisab.org/">(PISAB.org)</a> and the Village of Hope <a href="https://villageofhopeseattle.org/#mission">(Villageofhopeseattle.org)</a>, where I gained an anaylsis and practical experience applying that anaylsis in my personal and professional life.<BR>My day job is doing racial equity work (institutional).<br>However, I remain connected to a base of anti-racist organizers and movements committed to racial justice.<br>I have two grown sons who are my hereos in many ways.<br>Good jazz and hip hop music feed my soul. And, I'm always in search of delicious Black coffee. </p>
<p>I became aware of this Victory Code Bootcamp from an email blast which came from being introduced to an Unloop co-founder a few years ago. I am nervous, grateful, and excited to be here. I'm hoping to gain the skills to support small community based organizations and social justice movements with their presence on the Web.</p>
